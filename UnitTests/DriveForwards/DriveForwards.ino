/*
 * void StartDriving();
 * 
 * The StartDriving() function is utilized to move the BoeBot in the forward direction.
 * Initially maximum speeds of 1500us and 1300us (as mentioned in the Parallax Tutorials) 
 * were used. However, it soon became evident that the left servo was rotating slower 
 * than the right servo, and the sudden change in speed at the beginnning of the movement
 * caused the BoeBot to lose alignment. The solution to this problem was to re-calibrate 
 * the Servo's and add a linear acceleration at the beginning of the movement.
 * 
 *  
 * The Servo's were tested and calibrated according to Chapter 2 of the Parallax Module. 
 * CSV files were created to determine how the Rotational Velocity (RPM) changed with 
 * the Pulse Width (us). Based on this data maximum/minimum speeds and acceleration values 
 * were chosen for the Servo's
